# Overview

I have developed a web app using the Django framework in Python. This project focuses on creating a file upload and storage service with user accounts and file management capabilities. The goal is to dynamically generate web pages on the host server, allowing users to interact with the application through a user-friendly interface.

# Web App Description

The web app allows users to upload files, manage their uploaded files, and organize them within their accounts. To start the test server on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Django using the command: `pip install Django`
2. Create the initial project files with: `django-admin startproject my_project_name`
3. Create an app in your project with: `python manage.py startapp my_app_name`
4. Start the web app using: `python manage.py runserver`

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the first page of the app.

# Purpose

The purpose of developing this software is to provide users with a convenient and secure platform for uploading, managing, and organizing their files. The Django framework ensures efficient handling of user requests, enabling dynamic content generation and smooth interaction with the web app.
